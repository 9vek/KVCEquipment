# Kevyn's Vanilla Complementï¼šEquipment

Do you love the vanilla Minecraft as much as I do? And have you sometimes thought that Mojang just forgot about some should-be-there items and blocks,  or wanted many practical or interesting features in many small mods to be systematically integrated, or further more, hoped to improve the configurability of the vanilla Minecraft?

This project: **Kevyn's Vanilla Complement** (KVC),  is a Fabric mod project that I started with a whim recently, Aiming to supplement some contents to the vanilla MC. And I want to obey the following important design concepts: 

- Respect and follow the vanilla design concept
- Create new things from the old things
- Good systematicness and integration
- High configurability

Mods under the KVC project may not make drastic changes to MC, but they will incrementally enrich the content of the vanilla game. Moreover, I hope the add-ons under KVC project and the vanilla MC are harmonious, consistent, and interactive, and give to you who like MC flavor. I also hope to get your support and encouragement.

This mod, KVCEquipment, is the first mod of the KVC project. In my design mind map, **KVCEquipment** is responsible for completing the vanilla equipment set. In the future, it will take improving the equipment system and increasing the game-play joys as the update goal. In addition, there will be other mods worth looking forward to in the same project: 

- KVCBuildingBlocks
- KVCFood
- KVCCreatures
- KVCServerUtils
- And more

The source code of KVC project is all open source on GitHub, and the releases will also be post on Curseforge and MCBBS forum. Because the project is at a very initial stage, during this period, if you encounter problems with any mods under KVC project, please give me feedback at first time.

The last part of the introduction is about recruitment. If you agree with my design concept and are interested in MC mod development, you are welcome to provide suggestions, textures, models, recipes, codes, etc. to KVC project. feel free to send me a message if you want (there is no team or community yet, but I hope there will be one in the future), Let's improve our world together.
