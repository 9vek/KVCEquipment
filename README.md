## About this mod

**KVCEquipment** complements the equipment system of vanilla minecraft. At present, the items and features of the mod are as follows:

- redstone, lapis, emerald, copper and amethyst armors.
- redstone, lapis, emerald, copper, amethyst tools.
- redstone, lapis, emerald, copper and amethyst sword, bow and crossbow.
- a flame bow
- iron, gold, diamond, netherite bow and crossbow.
- rewrite the original bow and crossbow to make it more consistent and extensible
- a equipment value (hand feeling) system, all properties can be configured (currently being improved)
- rich configuration file, all values can be adjusted, and more settings will be added.
- all values of the original equipment can also be adjusted: D

And some of my future plan:

- more equipment 
- better balance
- better equipment value system, more differentiated design
- more settings will be added to the config, such as bow-pulling-deceleration, bow-range, etc.
- original monsters can be equipped with new armors and weapons to improve KVC&Vanilla's integration and consistency
- More interesting ideas, such as the arrow shoot by redstone bow can emit redstone power on it's way
- Or interesting ideas from you?

This mod is one of my early works, there are still many imperfections, and my development skills are not mature as well. If you are going to add this mod to your game, please pay attention to risks, and remember to feedback problems, update in time, and give me some support or encouragement, thx
